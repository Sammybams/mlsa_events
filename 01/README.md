# First - Event

## *Deploying ML models in notebooks using Azure ML Studio*

Discover how easy it is to deploy machine learning models in Azure with minimal coding experience required. This session will showcase the process of creating a model from a Jupyter notebook, testing and validating the model, logging with MLFlow and deploying it using Azure Machine Learning Studio. <br>

We'll cover how to convert your Jupyter notebooks into reusable scripts that can be used for production and deployment in Azure, exploring GPU and CPU options with Azure's Virtual Machines.
