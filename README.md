# MLSA EVENTS
## - 1. [Deploying ML models in notebooks using Azure Machine Learning](https://youtu.be/lyJeuuBzmBU)
Discover how easy it is to deploy machine learning models in Azure with minimal coding experience required. This session will showcase the process of creating a model from a Jupyter Notebook, testing and validating the model, logging with MLFlow and deploying it using Azure Machine Learning Studio.

We'll cover how to convert your Jupyter notebooks into reusable scripts that can be used for production and deployment in Azure, exploring GPU and CPU options with Azure's Virtual Machines.
